                <p className='text-base font-bold '>- The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled
                    by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled component, instead of
                    writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref
                    to get form values from the DOM.</p>

                <p className='text-base font-bold '>
                    In a controlled component, the form element's data is handled by the
                    React component (not DOM) and kept in the component's state.
                    A controlled component basically overrides the default behavior
                    of the HTML form elements.

                    We create a controlled component by connecting the form element
                    input textarea or select to the state by setting its attribute
                    value and the event onChange.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    PropTypes are a good first line defense when it comes to debugging your apps. But before getting into detail about PropTypes, we have to understand the concept of props.

                    Props are the read-only properties that are shared between components to give the unidirectional flow of React a dynamic touch. They're mainly shared from the parent component to the child component, but the reverse is also possible (though not recommended).

                    In this blog, we will discuss how to validate or check the props that we are passing to avoid complex debugging at a later stage.

                    What are PropTypes?
                    PropTypes are simply a mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype. This makes sure that we don’t receive an error at the very end of our app by the console which might not be easy to deal with.

                    I don't recommend using them in short apps like projects for self-practice but it's totally up to you. For larger projects like for a client, it's often a wise choice and a good practice to use them.

                    There are many different types of PropTypes and all of them have their unique ES6 classes which we can use. We will discuss every type in this article.

                    How to use PropTypes
                    Before the release of React 15.5.0, PropTypes were available in the React package, but now we have to add the prop-types library in our project.

                    We can do so by running the following command in our terminal:

                    npm install prop-types --save
                    We can use PropTypes to validate any data we are receiving from props. But before using it we will have to import it as always in our app:

                    import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
                    They are often used after the component ends and starts with the name of the component as shown:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div >

                    What is Node.js?
                </h1>
                <p>Node.js is defined as “a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.” Simply put, Node.js is an open-source and multi-platform environment that lets you build server-side applications and tools by using JavaScript.

                    Node.js brought JavaScript to the next level. While JavaScript is used as a client-side development language, Node.js covers the server-side programming. Thanks to the Node.js, JavaScript has become an all-purpose full-stack development language.

                    The JS frontend and Node.js backend are easier to keep in sync because of a single language used on both sides of the application. Node.js allows your programs to be written in JavaScript and to be executed on the server.

                    Node.js has become one of the most popular tools in the back end development. Enterprise companies like eBay, Netflix, and Uber all support the use of Node.js through a personal example.

                    Jeff Harrell, the director of engineering at PayPal, spoke up about Node.js. He said, “Node.js powers our web applications and has allowed our teams to move much faster in bringing their designs to life.”

                    One of the reasons why Node.js is so popular is that front end developers can learn it pretty quickly since Node inherits many JavaScript features.

                    Developer-wise, Node.js made it possible to share and reuse code. With the help of Node modules, developers can use prebuilt modules or repurpose their own.

                    Node is a part of popular MEAN, and MERN JavaScript centered technology stacks that cover an entire web development pipeline. There are many frameworks built for Node (such as Meteor, Sails, etc.) and Express.js is one of them. </p>

                    What is Express.js?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Express.js is a minimal, flexible, and open-source Node.js web application framework. You can use it on top of Node.js to ensure better web functionality. Express is the most popular Node.js web framework.

                    What it provides is a vast set of features for building web applications (single, multi-page, and hybrid). With Express, you can structure a web application that can handle multiple HTTP requests at a certain URL.

                    Flexibility is visible in numerous components accessible on a package manager. These components automatically persevere into Express.js.

                    The reason why Express is the most popular web framework is that it makes the development of web apps, websites, and APIs easier. It also offers an underlying collection of topographies.

                    With Express.js, you’ll get to hone different aspects of the web application. You can determine settings like the location of templates that will be used for the response or the port that will be used for establishing a connection.
